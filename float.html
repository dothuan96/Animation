            Saber's True Name is Artoria Pendragon (Lily), better known as Arthur Pendragon and King Arthur, a child born with the destiny to save the Isle of Britain, which was heading towards ruin due the fading of mystery.
            She is an "incarnation of the dragon", a red dragon who would protect Britain, created by the plan of the previous king, Uther, and the magus Merlin. As a result, her heart was replaced with a dragon's one, "Pendragon" (the last name used by Artoria's family).
            In this state, she is known as the Knight Princess (騎士姫, Kishi-hime?), who wielded Caliburn as an inexperienced knight that had had just began walking down the path of a king. To learn more about the world, Artoria traveled the land and engaged in many adventures.
            The people she saved in his time called her the Knight Princess for her brilliance and beauty.
